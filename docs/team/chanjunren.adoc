== About The Project

My team of 4 Computer Science students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface
desktop address book application for our CS2103T module, and we chose to modify it into a 3-in-1 application that serves
as a tool to aid revision called StudyBuddy. This application allows students to store and utilize flashcards, create
notes that can be later used to generate a reference to create a cheat sheet.

This is what our project looks like:

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *ability to start a time trial of flashcards.*
** What it does: The `timetrial` command initializes a test whereby the user will be tested a sequence of flashcards.
** Justification: Pushes the user to test his understanding / familiarity of a certain topic.
** Highlights: This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. An in-depth analysis of design
alternatives was necessary to implement the feature in a way that doesnâ€™t disrupt other features. The implementation was also challenging because there was a need to read up on an existing API that I did not have prior experience in.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: Designed the overall GUI of the StudyBuddyPro application.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#=undefined&search=chanjunren[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_
