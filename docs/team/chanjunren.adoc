== About The Project

My team of 4 Computer Science students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface
desktop address book application for our CS2103T module, and we chose to modify it into a 3-in-1 application that serves
as a tool to aid revision called StudyBuddy. This application allows students to store and utilize flashcards, create
notes that can be later used to generate a reference to create a cheat sheet.

This is what our project looks like:

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *ability to start a time trial of flashcards.*
** What it does: The `timetrial` command initializes a test whereby the user will be tested a sequence of flashcards.
** Justification: Pushes the user to test his understanding / familiarity of a certain topic.
** Highlights: This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. An in-depth analysis of design
alternatives was necessary to implement the feature in a way that doesn’t disrupt other features. The implementation was also challenging because there was a need to read up on an existing API that I did not have prior experience in.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: Designed the overall GUI of the StudyBuddyPro application.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#=undefined&search=chanjunren[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests https://github.com[#33], https://github.com[#34])
*** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests https://github.com[#36], https://github.com[#38])
** Documentation:
*** Did cosmetic tweaks to existing contents of the User Guide: https://github.com[#14]
** Community:
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): https://github.com[#12], https://github.com[#32], https://github.com[#19], https://github.com[#42]
*** Contributed to forum discussions (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3], https://github.com[4])
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3])
*** Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates (https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2])
** Tools:
*** Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project (https://github.com[#42])
*** Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo

=== Flashcards Time Trial Feature

[IMPORTANT]
The following commands assume that the user is in the _flashcard_ mode.

==== Implementation
a.	The time trial mechanism is facilitated by the `FlashcardTabWindowController`, and mainly uses the `Timeline`, `KeyFrame` and `KeyValue` class from the JavaFX package to support its functionality.

The following _figure_ shows a class diagram of the relevant classes of the time trial feature.

The following _figure_ is an activity diagram of the flow of events when a user attempts to start a time trial.

b.	Given below is an example usage scenario and how the time trial mechanism behaves at each step.
c. Upon initialization of the StudyBuddy and switching to the Flashcard window, the `StudyBuddyParser`’s function enum will be set to parse `Flashcard` commands.
d.	The user executes (timetrial cs2100), and the `StartTimeTrialCommand` retrieves a List of flashcards with the associated `Tag` through the `Model#getTaggedFlashcards`, which is then passed into the `FlashcardTabWindowController`.
e.	The `FlashcardTabWindowController` then calls the `FlashcardTabWindowController#startTimeTrial`, which in turns construct a `Timeline` with the following added for 3 flashcards:
1.	A `KeyFrame` to call the `FlashcardTabWindowController#loadTimeTrial` method, which displays the question of the flashcard on the window, with a `KeyValue` that starts the timer on the screen.
2.	A `KeyFrame` to call the `FlashcardTabWindowController#showFlashcardAns` method, which hides the Timer and flashes the answer of the flashcard for a set period of time.
3.	A `KeyFrame` is then added to the timeline to call the `FlashcardTabWindowController#resetViews` method, which in turn empties the qnsTextArea and ansTextArea. [TO BE REFORMATTED]


The following _figure_ shows the sequence diagram of when the command `timetrial cs2103t` is executed.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How the timetrial is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** 1.	Using the `TimeLine` class to set the timer
object.
** Pros: Tidier and easier to understand.
** Cons: Have to read up on the API and learn about the relevant classes such as `KeyFrame` and `KeyValue`
* **Alternative 2:** Looping `Thread.sleep()` to set the timer
** Pros: Easier to implement
** Cons: Code will be messier and harder to read

===== Aspect: How to continue the time trial

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Each flashcard and its’ respective answer is displayed for a set period of time before the next flashcard**
** Pros: Easier to implement
** Cons: Inflexible as user can only view the answer for a set amount of time
* **Alternative 2:** Allowing users to input commands to display the flashcard answer / move on to the next flashcard
** Pros: Better flow of time trial feature and improved user experience
** Cons: Hard to implement

==== [Proposed] Future improvements
** Allowing users to set their own time limit for each flashcard in the time trial mode
*** Command will be inputted to set the duration of the timer for each flashcard
** Allowing users to decide when to move on to the next flashcard
*** Question will still be shown for a fixed period of time, but a command will be required to move on to the next flashcard instead of just flashing the answer for a set amount of time
