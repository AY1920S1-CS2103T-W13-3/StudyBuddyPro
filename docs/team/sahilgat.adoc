== Overview

This document serves as an overview of my contributions to the StudyBuddyPro project. This project was
part of an introductory software engineering module known as *CS2103T*. Moreover,
the document aims to highlight my technical competence and documentation skills by using
the StudyBuddyPro project as an example.

StudyBuddyPro was developed by https://github.com/Sahilgat[me],
https://github.com/Sam-limyr[Samuel Lim],
https://github.com/chanjunren[Chan Jun Ren],
https://github.com/ckb055[Chen Kai Bin] and
https://github.com/jaesimin[Jasmine Yeo Jia Min], all sophomore students from National University of
Singapore (NUS) studying Computer Science.

== Introduction

StudyBuddyPro is a desktop application designed for university students in computing-related
fields to supplement their revision. StudyBuddyPro aims to consolidate commonly used studying tools
into one integrated platform so the student does not have to fuss about switching between different
applications. This prevents disorganisation and improves convenience.

StudyBuddyPro was developed for use through a Command Line Interface (CLI) to take advantage
of the typing proficiency of computing students. However, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is
also provided for easier viewing, therefore providing the best of both worlds.

StudyBuddyPro has 3 main features: Flashcard, Notes and Cheatsheet. The purpose of each
feature is summarized in the table below.

|===
| Feature | Purpose
| Flashcard  | Create flashcards for quick revision and effective retention
| Notes | Create general-purpose notes
| Cheatsheet | Create and customize cheatsheets from relevant content found in Flashcard and Note features

== Summary of contributions

|===
|This section provides an overview of the technical and non-technical contributions I made to the development
of StudyBuddyPro. They highlight my ability to: +
1) Design, model and implement features that are appropriate for our target users. +
2) Work in a software development team setting and handle non-technical tasks such as documentation. +
3) Design test cases and write quality code that abides by software engineering principles. +

* *Major Feature Enhancements*

** Developed the Flashcard `Model`, `Logic` and `Storage` components. This enhancement provides the functionality for one of
the three core features in the StudyBuddyPro application. Without it, the application would be
missing a key revision tool that students could have used and the application would be less attractive to the
target market.
*** What this enhancement included:
**** The `Flashcard` object model and its components such as `Question`, `Answer`, `Title` and `Statistics` objects.
**** Basic commands to use the flashcard model such as `add` and `list`. Advanced features such as the *remind* feature.
**** Saving to and reading from storage files.
*** *Depth*:
**** Implementing this enhancement required a deep technical understanding of the architecture of the
software as it modified 3 out of the 4 major components.
*** *Completeness*:
**** The enhancement is fully functional and goes beyond the basic needs of the user.
**** Advanced features like the *remind* feature makes use of scientifically established
spaced repetition techniques so the user can effectively revise.
**** Each flashcard's last viewed
date is tracked and our application automatically sets the next date the flashcard should
be viewed next which the user can check.
**** If the user tries to exit the application while there
are still unrevised flashcards, the application will automatically warn the user about the
unrevised flashcards and require a second confirmation before exiting.
*** *Effort*:
**** Understanding the entire existing architecture of the software was extremely challenging.
**** The enhancement modified and improved existing commands, while also linking various
commands which was very tricky to implement.
**** The quantity of features added in this enhancement made it very time-consuming.

* *Minor Feature Enhancements*

** Added a `CommandHistory` class that stores all commands a user inputs while using StudyBuddyPro.
*** This class was used to develop the *remind* feature described earlier.
*** This class was later used by my teammates to improve the existing `delete` commands in all
features. This provided an additional layer of safety for the user by preventing accidental deletions.

** Added a *Flashcard Bank* that provides users with a set of useful flashcards when the application
first starts up.
*** The flashcards contained helpful tips for computing students. (Our target demographic)
*** This feature was also used during the product demo of our application for the module.

** Code quality
*** Refactored `CommandResult` that all other features used. (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/pull/195[#195])
*** Refactored `Storage` that all other features used. (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/pull/340[#340])
*** Added more specific exceptions such as `DuplicateFlashcardQuestionException` and `DuplicateFlashcardTitleException`
rather than generic exceptions such as `DuplicateFlashcardException`. This provided better logging for developers.

* *Other contributions*

** Project Management

*** Set-up the GitHub developers page for our team.
*** Managed milestone https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/milestone/1[v1.0] and https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/milestone/2[v1.1] on GitHub. (2/5 milestones)
*** Managed the issue tracker for our project repository by assigning issues, cross-referencing pull
requests with issues and closing issues when completed. (Pull request https://10github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/pull/340[#340], Issue https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/issues/301[#301])
