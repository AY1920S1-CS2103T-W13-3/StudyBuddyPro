== Overview

This document serves as an overview of my contributions to the StudyBuddyPro project. This project was
part of an introductory software engineering module known as *CS2103T*. Moreover,
the document aims to highlight my technical competence and documentation skills by using
the StudyBuddyPro project as an example.

StudyBuddyPro was developed by https://github.com/Sahilgat[me],
https://github.com/Sam-limyr[Samuel Lim],
https://github.com/chanjunren[Chan Jun Ren],
https://github.com/ckb055[Chen Kai Bin] and
https://github.com/jaesimin[Jasmine Yeo Jia Min], all sophomore students from National University of
Singapore (NUS) studying Computer Science.

== Introduction

StudyBuddyPro is a desktop application designed for university students in computing-related
fields to supplement their revision. StudyBuddyPro aims to consolidate commonly used studying tools
into one integrated platform so the student does not have to fuss about switching between different
applications. This prevents disorganisation and improves convenience.

StudyBuddyPro was developed for use through a Command Line Interface (CLI) to take advantage
of the typing proficiency of computing students. However, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is
also provided for easier viewing, therefore providing the best of both worlds.

StudyBuddyPro has 3 main features: Flashcard, Notes and Cheatsheet. The purpose of each
feature is summarized in the table below.

.Features table
[options = "header"]
|===
| Feature | Purpose
| Flashcard  | Create flashcards for quick revision and effective retention
| Notes | Create general-purpose notes
| Cheatsheet | Create and customize cheatsheets from relevant content found in Flashcard and Note features

* *Major Feature Enhancements*

** Developed the Flashcard `Model`, `Logic` and `Storage` components. This enhancement provides the functionality for one of
the three core features in the StudyBuddyPro application. Without it, the application would be
missing a key revision tool that students could have used and the application would be less attractive to the
target market.
*** What this enhancement included:
**** The `Flashcard` object model and its components such as `Question`, `Answer`, `Title` and `Statistics` objects.
**** Basic commands to use the flashcard model such as `add` and `list`. Advanced features such as the *remind* feature.
**** Saving to and reading from storage files.
*** *Depth*:
**** Implementing this enhancement required a deep technical understanding of the architecture of the
software as it modified 3 out of the 4 major components.
*** *Completeness*:
**** The enhancement is fully functional and goes beyond the basic needs of the user.
**** Advanced features like the *remind* feature makes use of scientifically established
spaced repetition techniques so the user can effectively revise.
**** Each flashcard's last viewed
date is tracked and our application automatically sets the next date the flashcard should
be viewed next which the user can check.
**** If the user tries to exit the application while there
are still unrevised flashcards, the application will automatically warn the user about the
unrevised flashcards and require a second confirmation before exiting.
*** *Effort*:
**** Understanding the entire existing architecture of the software was extremely challenging.
**** The enhancement modified and improved existing commands, while also linking various
commands which was very tricky to implement.
**** The quantity of features added in this enhancement made it very time-consuming.

* *Minor Feature Enhancements*

** Added a `CommandHistory` class that stores all commands a user inputs while using StudyBuddyPro.
*** This class was used to develop the *remind* feature described earlier.
*** This class was later used by my teammates to improve the existing `delete` commands in all
features. This provided an additional layer of safety for the user by preventing accidental deletions.

** Added a *Flashcard Bank* that provides users with a set of useful flashcards when the application
first starts up.
*** The flashcards contained helpful tips for computing students. (Our target demographic)
*** This feature was also used during the product demo of our application for the module.

** Code quality
*** Refactored `CommandResult` that all other features used. (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/pull/195[#195])
*** Refactored `Storage` that all other features used. (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/pull/340[#340])
*** Added more specific exceptions such as `DuplicateFlashcardQuestionException` and `DuplicateFlashcardTitleException`
rather than generic exceptions such as `DuplicateFlashcardException`. This provided better logging for developers.

[In line with SRP?]

image::FlashcardSuccess.PNG[width="700"]

=== How to create a flashcard: `add`

Adds a flashcard from user input question <QUESTION> and answer <ANSWER>.

    Format: add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER t/TITLE [tag/TAG]...

Example usage:

    add q/What is 100 Binary in its Decimal form? a/4 t/Binary Stuff tag/CS2100

Expected output:
```
New flashcard added:
    New flashcard added: Title: Binary Stuff
    Tags: [cs2100]
```

=== Editing a flashcard: `edit` (Coming in v2.0)

Edits a flashcard's question, answer, title, or tags. The flashcard will be referred to by their original title
`ORIGINAL_TITLE`.

    Format: edit ORIGINAL_TITLE [q/NEW_QUESTION] [a/ANSWER] [t/TITLE] [tag/TAG]...

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.

Example usage:

    edit IntelliJ Question 1 q/What is the meaning of SLAP? a/Single Layer of Abstraction Principle t/SE Question 1

Expected output:
```
Edited flashcard:
    Title: SE Question 1
    Question: What is the meaning of SLAP?
    Tags: [cs2100]
```

* Notice how the fields that are not edited retain their original information. For example,
the _tag_ field was not changed and so the original _cs2100_ tag was retained.

* Multiple fields can be edited at the same time. In the example, the _question_, _answer_
and _title_ fields were all edited at once.

=== How to view a list of all available flashcards: `list`

Lists all flashcards.

   Format: list

Example usage:

    list

Expected output:
```
Listed all flashcards:
    Title: Pipelineing Question 1
    Tags: [CS2100]
```

=== How to delete a flashcard: `delete`

Deletes the flashcard by <FLASHCARD_INDEX>.

The user will be prompted again to confirm their deletion.

   Format: delete (index)

Example usage:

    delete 6

Expected output:
```
Are you sure you would like to delete the following flashcard?
    Title: Binary Question 1
    Tags: [cs2100]
    Please use `delete 6` again to confirm your deletion..
```

Upon keying in `delete 6` again, then the flashcard will be deleted.

Expected output:

```
Deleted Flashcard:  Title: Binary Question 1
    Tags: [cs2100]
```

=== Find out what flashcards to revise today, or ones you may have missed: `remind`

This feature helps the user check which flashcards are due for revision today and which flashcards
overdue for revision. Don't worry, StudyBuddyPro automatically sets the date the flashcard should next be
viewed at for optimal learning. These increments also scale with time i.e. newer flashcards will
have to be viewed more often.

[TIP]
Be sure to check in everyday to see which flashcards you have due!

[NOTE]
StudyBuddyPro only marks a flashcard as revised and removes it from the due and
overdue flashcard list when you see the flashcard's _answer_ not just its question! For
example, simply using the `view` command without the `show` command to reveal the flashcard's
answer will not trick the system. Sorry, it's for your own good!

Example usage:

    remind

If no flashcards due for revision today and no overdue flashcards:

Expected output:
```
Well done - No due or overdue flashcards!
```

If there are flashcards due for revision today but no overdue flashcards:

Expected output:
```
Here are the flashcards due today:
1. Math Question 1 - What is 2 x 2?
```

If there are no flashcards due for revision today but there are overdue flashcards:

Expected output:
```
Here are your overdue flashcards:
1. Math Question 1 - What is 2 x 2? (Was due on 2019-10-30)
```

If there are both flashcards due for revision today and overdue flashcards:

Expected output:
```
Here are the flashcards due today:
1. Math Question 1 - What is 2 x 2?
Here are your overdue flashcards:
1. Math Question 2 - What is 3 x 2? (Was due on 2019-10-30)
```

== FAQ

*Q*: Help! Double-clicking `StudyBuddyPro.jar` does not launch the application - what
should I do? +
*A*: Trying running the application from the command line using the following command:
`java -jar StudyBuddyPro.jar`. Windows users can use the Command Prompt application to
do this while Mac users can use the Terminal application.
