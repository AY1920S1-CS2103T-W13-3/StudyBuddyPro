== Introduction

StudyBuddy Pro specifically caters to students in the School of Computing at NUS
that prefer to use a desktop app to help their studies.
StudyBuddy is also optimized for those who prefer to work with
a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). Being highly familiar working with CLI,
Computing Students can greatly benefit from the app to
manage their studies efficiently which also aims to be faster than traditional GUI apps.
