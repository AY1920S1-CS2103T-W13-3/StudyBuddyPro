== Introduction

StudyBuddy Pro specifically caters to students in the School of Computing at NUS
that prefer to use a desktop app to help their studies.

Graphical User Interface (GUI). Being highly familiar working with CLI,
Computing Students can greatly benefit from the app to
manage their studies efficiently and faster than traditional GUI apps.
