== Introduction

StudyBuddyPro is a student application that aims to simplify the hassle of revision
by providing a suite of tools for effective revision.

StudyBuddyPro is optimized for students who prefer to work with
a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Moreover, StudyBuddyPro comes geared with pre-loaded features specially
catered for computing students. So whether you're a computing student getting
used to a CLI for the first time or if you're a CLI expert who wants to reap
the benefits of a fast typing speed, give StudyBuddyPro a try! {To be implemented!}

If you're interested, head over to the
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#2-quick-start[Quick Start]
section to get started!

== Quick Start

NOTE: Please ensure you have Java 11 or above installed before proceeding!

1. Download the latest version of `StudyBuddyPro.jar` https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/releases[here].

2. Place the file in the folder you want to set as the home directory. All data and
miscellaneous files associated with StudyBuddyPro will be placed in this folder.

3. Double-click `StudyBuddyPro.jar` to launch the application. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. If not, please
refer to the first question in the
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#8-FAQ[FAQ]
for help!

4. Type a command in the command box execute it by pressing kbd:[Enter]. Refer to the
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#9-command-summary[Command Summary]
section for a quick overview of all the available commands!

== Command Format / Rules

Things noted here are standardization of the User Guide.
These points are absolute, unless stated otherwise in the specific section(s).

=== How to read the Command sections

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.
E.g. `add t/TITLE` -> `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Midterm notes`.

* Items indicated in square brackets are optional.
E.g `t/TITLE [tag/TAG]` can be used as `t/Midterm note tag/exam` or as `t/Midterm`.

* Items with `...`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
E.g. `[tag/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `tag/friend`, `tag/friend tag/family`.

=== General rules for all commands

* All commands are written in English with alphanumeric characters.

* Any indexes provided (denoted by `id`) must be a positive integer (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ...).

* All flashcards, notes, and cheatsheets can have a maximum of 10 tags.

* Only exact matches of any searches will be returned.
E.g. "noted" will return "noted" but not "note" or "notes"

* All searches are case insensitive.
E.g. 'cs2103t' will match 'CS2103T'

== Global Commands

Global commands in StudyBuddyPro are commands that can be called regardless of which mode the user is currently in.

=== Entering the various modes of StudyBuddyPro: `switch`

Upon startup, you will be prompted to enter one of the modes before you can proceed.

==== Getting into Flashcard mode: `switch fc`

=== Exiting the application: `exit`

Checks if there are any remaining flashcards to revise for the day
or overdue flashcards to revise before exiting the application.

    Example usage: exit

If there are flashcards due for revision today but no overdue flashcards:

    Expected output: Are you sure you want to exit? You still have the following flashcards overdue or left
    to revise for today:
    Here are the flashcards due today:

== Notes Feature:

=== Creating a note: `add`

* Adds a note from user input with title `TITLE` and content `CONTENT`. The title of the note cannot be a duplicate
of an existing note title.

    Format: add t/TITLE c/CONTENT [tag/TAG]...

    Example usage: add t/Pipelining Definition c/Pipelining is a process where a processor executes multiple processes
    simultaneously. tag/CS2100

* More advanced usage: Tagging of note fragments is also supported. The note fragment tagging is added at the
same time as the note is created.

* Note fragment tags are added with content `FRAGMENT_CONTENT`, at least one tag
`FRAGMENT_TAG`, and any number of additional tags `ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENT_TAG`:

    Format (within CONTENT): /* C/FRAGMENT_CONTENT TAG/FRAGMENT_TAG [TAG/ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENT_TAG]... */

IMPORTANT: The format for Note fragment content is 'C/', not 'c/', and the format for Note fragment tags is 'TAG/', not
'tag/'.

* In the following example, two note fragment tags are added to the same note fragment:

    Example usage: add t/About c/Notes can be /* C/highlighted TAG/highlight TAG/important */ if needed. tag/about

Expected output:

    New note added:
        Title: About
        Content: Notes can be /* C/highlighted TAG/cs2100 TAG/important */ if needed.
        Tags: [about]

* This adds a note with content "Notes can be highlighted if needed.", and a note fragment tag with content
"highlighted" and two tags "cs2100" and "important".

* Multiple note fragment tags are allowed. These do not interfere with the other tags of the Note.

IMPORTANT: Overlapping note fragment tags are not allowed.

NOTE: Note fragment tags can be used for filtering notes (see Section 6.6), or filtering globally (see Section 4.3).
For a clearer visualization of note fragments, compare the `view` (see Section 6.3) and `viewraw` (see Section 6.4)
commands.

=== Deleting a note: `delete`

Deletes the note of index `NOTE_INDEX`.

The user will be prompted once to confirm their deletion.
