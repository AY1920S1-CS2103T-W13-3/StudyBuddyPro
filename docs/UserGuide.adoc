== Introduction

StudyBuddyPro is a student application that aims to simplify the hassle of revision
by providing a suite of tools for effective revision.

StudyBuddyPro is optimized for students who prefer to work with
a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Moreover, StudyBuddyPro comes geared with pre-loaded features specially
catered for computing students. So whether you're a computing student getting
used to a CLI for the first time or if you're a CLI expert who wants to reap
the benefits of a fast typing speed, give StudyBuddyPro a try! {To be implemented!}

If you're interested, head over to the
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#2-quick-start[Quick Start]
section to get started!

== Quick Start

NOTE: Please ensure you have Java 11 or above installed before proceeding!

1. Download the latest version of `StudyBuddyPro.jar` https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/releases[here].

2. Place the file in the folder you want to set as the home directory. All data and
miscellaneous files associated with StudyBuddyPro will be placed in this folder.

3. Double-click `StudyBuddyPro.jar` to launch the application. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. If not, please
refer to the first question in the
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#8-FAQ[FAQ]
for help!

4. Type a command in the command box execute it by pressing kbd:[Enter]. Refer to the
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#9-command-summary[Command Summary]
section for a quick overview of all the available commands!

== Command Format / Rules

Things noted here are standardization of the User Guide.
These points are absolute, unless stated otherwise in the specific section(s).

=== How to read the Command sections

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.
E.g. `add t/TITLE` -> `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Midterm notes`.

* Items indicated in square brackets are optional.
E.g `t/TITLE [tag/TAG]` can be used as `t/Midterm note tag/exam` or as `t/Midterm`.

* Items with `...`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
E.g. `[tag/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `tag/friend`, `tag/friend tag/family`.

=== General rules for all commands

* All commands are written in English with alphanumeric characters.

* Any indexes provided (denoted by `id`) must be a positive integer (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ...).

* All flashcards, notes, and cheatsheets can have a maximum of 10 tags.

* Only exact matches of any searches will be returned.
E.g. "noted" will return "noted" but not "note" or "notes"

* All searches are case insensitive.
E.g. 'cs2103t' will match 'CS2103T'

== Global Commands

Global commands in StudyBuddyPro are commands that can be called regardless of which mode the user is currently in.
