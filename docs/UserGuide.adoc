== Introduction

StudyBuddy Level 1 is for students in the School of Computing at NUS
that prefer to use a desktop app to help their studies.
StudyBuddy is also optimized for those who prefer to work with
a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). Being highly familiar working with CLI,
Computing Students can greatly benefit from the app to
manage their studies efficiently and faster than traditional GUI apps.
